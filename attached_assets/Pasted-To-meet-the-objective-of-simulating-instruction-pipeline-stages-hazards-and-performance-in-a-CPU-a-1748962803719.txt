To meet the objective of simulating instruction pipeline stages, hazards, and performance in a CPU architecture, you can develop a simplified but powerful project in C++, Python, or JavaScript that mimics how modern CPUs execute instructions using pipelining.

🎯 Project Objective
To design and simulate a pipelined CPU model with instruction stages, handle hazards (data, control, and structural), measure performance (CPI, speedup, stall cycles), and demonstrate understanding of computer architecture and system abstraction.

🔧 Core Concepts to Simulate
✅ 1. Instruction Pipeline Stages
Typical 5-stage RISC pipeline:

IF – Instruction Fetch

ID – Instruction Decode

EX – Execute

MEM – Memory Access

WB – Write Back

✅ 2. Hazards
Simulate and detect the following:

Data Hazards – RAW (Read After Write), WAR, WAW

Control Hazards – Due to branching

Structural Hazards – Resource conflict (e.g., shared memory/ALU)

✅ 3. Hazard Mitigation
Forwarding (Bypassing)

Stalling (Pipeline bubbles)

Branch Prediction (static/dynamic)

Scoreboarding / Tomasulo’s algorithm (advanced, optional)

🛠️ Suggested Implementation Steps
🧱 1. Define Instruction Set
Use a small, simplified ISA (like MIPS subset):
Example:

asm
Copy
Edit
add R1, R2, R3
lw R4, 0(R1)
beq R1, R2, LABEL
🧠 2. Abstract Pipeline Model
Create data structures to represent:

Instruction Queue

Pipeline Registers between stages

Hazard Detector and Forwarding Unit

Cycle Counter and Statistics

🧪 3. Simulate Clock Cycles
On each clock cycle:

Move instructions through stages

Check and resolve hazards

Insert NOPs if required

Record stats (e.g., CPI, stalls)

📈 Output & Analysis
🔍 Performance Metrics
Total Cycles

Instructions Executed

CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)

Number of Stalls due to hazards

Speedup (compared to non-pipelined execution)

🧾 Example Output (Text/Console/Table)
text
Copy
Edit
Cycle: 12
Instructions Executed: 10
Stalls: 3 (Data: 2, Control: 1)
CPI: 1.2
Speedup over sequential: 3.5x
💻 Tools & Tech Stack
🐍 Python (Easy to simulate & visualize)
Use OOP for stages and instructions

Use matplotlib for performance graphs (optional)

🚀 Optional: Web-based JavaScript App
Simulate pipeline step-by-step with UI animations
