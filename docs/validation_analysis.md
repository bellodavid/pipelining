## 4. Conclusion

The validation and sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the CPU pipeline simulator accurately models the behavior of a 5-stage RISC pipeline. The model correctly identifies and resolves hazards, produces performance metrics that align with theoretical expectations, and responds appropriately to parameter variations.

The sensitivity analysis reveals that:

1. Forwarding has the most significant impact on reducing data hazard penalties
2. Branch prediction accuracy strongly influences overall performance
3. Instruction mix dramatically affects CPI and pipeline efficiency
4. Code optimization techniques can substantially improve performance

These findings align with established computer architecture principles and provide valuable insights for both educational purposes and optimization strategies. The model refinements implemented based on this analysis have improved the accuracy and usefulness of the simulator as both an educational tool and a performance analysis platform.
